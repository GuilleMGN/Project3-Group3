# Crypto Crowdfunding 


## Description
This project aims to start a crowdfunding contract in solidity and distribute NFTs as an incentive for contributors in a form of a picture (using a streamlit front end).

## Centralized vs Decentralized Contracts


Smart Contracts can be considered to be  back-end APIs running in the Blockchain, Decentralized Applications are the front-end or UX. They represent the visible layer connecting users or other applications with the Smart Contracts running in the Blockchain.

Every Ethereum node connected to the Blockchain exposes an RPC-JSON interface over HTTPS or Web Sockets that any Dapp can use to connect and submit transactions.

 A client library is required in your language of preference to talk to that interface.
 
 A blockchain can be either centralized or decentralized. It is important, however, that decentralized not be confused with distributed. While a 
 
blockchain is inherently distributed (meaning that many parties hold copies of the ledger), it is not inherently decentralized.

Whether a blockchain is centralized or decentralized simply refers to the rights of participants on the ledger, and is therefore a question of design.

In a decentralized network, anyone can participate and transact on the ledger. As a result, mechanisms must exist in order to combat the vulnerabilities

that arise from this design and to ensure that transactions are correct. Bitcoin, for example, is a decentralized blockchain that uses mining and proof-
 
of-work* to maintain the integrity of the ledger and to prevent people from corrupting the system.A centralized network, on the other hand, is made up

of parties whose identities are known. Thus, the system is valid because only credible and reputable participants can post to the 

ledger. Because participants’ identities are known, their transactions can therefore be audited.

As an example of centralization, the contract allows the deployer(end user) to choose whether or not the contract should have the option to issue  refunds to its contributors.
